Software Quality Handbook Plan

We had a teams meeting, and we decided to  divided the work up between us with a plan in place to complete the work by the deadline.

As a group, we must research on each topic below:

Task estimation in Scrum
Code reviews
Dev ops

After discussing with the team, we choose  dev ops as our third topic to research for the assignment . Becuase we are a group of three , we chose to work on one topic each.

Here is how we broke up the work

Ifeoma 
Topic : Task estimation in Scrum

I will include the importance of user stories and their role in task estimation.
