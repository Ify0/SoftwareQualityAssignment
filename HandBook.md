# Welcome to our Handbook

### Task estimation in Scrum

This guide is designed to equip both new and existing team members with essential knowledge and techniques for effectively estimating tasks within the Scrum framework.
By understanding the principles outlined in this handbook, you will contribute to the success of our projects by delivering value to our customers in a timely and efficient manner.

Scrum, as an agile framework, embodies core principles that emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability in response to change.
At its essence, Scrum enables teams to deliver value incrementally, with a focus on continuous improvement throughout the development process.
By embracing agile project management methodologies like Scrum, organizations can effectively navigate the complexities of modern software development and deliver high-quality products that meet evolving customer needs.

Key Principles of Scrum:

1. **Iterative Development**:
   Scrum promotes iterative development cycles known as Sprints, typically lasting between one to four weeks.
   Each Sprint delivers a potentially shippable increment of the product, allowing for rapid feedback and adaptation.
2. **Collaboration**:
   Collaboration is at the heart of Scrum. Cross-functional teams work together closely, with clear communication channels established between team members, stakeholders, and customers.
   This collaborative approach fosters creativity, innovation, and shared ownership of project outcomes.
3. **Responding to Change**: Scrum recognizes that requirements and priorities may change over time.
   Therefore, the framework encourages flexibility and adaptability, enabling teams to respond quickly to new information and emerging challenges.
4. **Adaptive Planning**:
   Rather than focusing to rigid, upfront planning, Scrum adaptes planning techniques.
   Teams plan for each Sprint based on current priorities and available information, allowing for adjustments as needed to optimize project outcomes.

By adhering to these fundamental principles, Scrum empowers teams to deliver value early and often, while also fostering a culture of continuous improvement and learning.

**Importance of User Stories in Task Estimation:**

User stories serve as a cornerstone of effective task estimation within the Scrum framework. These concise descriptions of features, told from the perspective of end-users, provide a clear and tangible representation of customer needs and expectations. By capturing requirements in the form of user stories, teams can ensure that their focus remains solely on delivering value to the customer.

Key Aspects of User Stories:

1. **Capturing Requirements**: User stories have specific functionalities that address the users needs. By articulating requirements in a user-centric manner, teams gain a deeper understanding of the problem domain and can tailor their solutions accordingly.
2. **Facilitating Collaboration**: User stories promote collaboration between stakeholders and development teams. By involving stakeholders in the creation and editing of user stories, teams ensure that their efforts are aligned with customer expectations and business objectives.
3. **Enabling Prioritization**: User stories provide a basis for prioritising work items within the product backlog. By assigning which is more important to each user story, teams can make informed decisions about which features to focus on during Sprint Planning.
4. **Enhancing Estimation**: User stories serve as the basis for task estimation in Scrum. By breaking down features into smaller, more manageable units of work, teams can estimate the effort required to implement each user story with greater accuracy.

Overall, user stories play a critical role in ensuring that development efforts are focused on delivering tangible value to the customer, while also providing a framework for effective task estimation within the Scrum framework.

**Popular Task Estimation Technique in Scrum:**

Task estimation is a vital aspect of Sprint Planning in Scrum, enabling teams to forecast the amount of work they can commit to during a Sprint accurately. Several estimation techniques are commonly used within the Scrum framework, each with its own benefits and considerations. Planning poker is one of the popluar techniques used.

If you are part of a team. This project involves completing different tasks such as like writing code, designing features, or fixing bugs. Each of these tasks has its own level of difficulty. Some are easy, and others are more complex.

Planning poker is like a game each memeber figures out how difficult each task is. These are the steps below:

1. **Team Gathering**: The team sits together to discuss the tasks that need to be done. These tasks are represented as "user stories" .
2. **Assigning Points**: Instead of just guessing how hard each task is, team members use "story points" to rate them. Story points are like units of measurement for task complexity. The higher the points, the more complex the task.
3. **Discussion and Consensus**: Each team member privately chooses a number of story points they think represents the complexity of a task. Then, everyone reveals their choices at the same time. If there are big differences in estimates, team members discuss why they chose their numbers and try to reach a consensus.
4. **Repeating the Process**: The team goes through this process for each task until they have estimates for all of them.

The goal of planning poker is to make sure everyone on the team understands the work involved in each task and agrees on how long it will take to complete them. This helps with planning the project timeline and ensures everyone is on the same page about what needs to be done.

By understanding Scrum principles, recognising the importance of user stories, and employing popular estimation techniques, teams can enhance their ability to deliver value efficiently and effectively within the Scrum framework.

### Testing
**This is the introduction part for Testing.**
This guide is tailored to create brand new team members as well as the experienced members possess knowledge of methods in the Testing.Therefore, as a result from adopting these norms we will improve the level of services for people, but nevertheless will have the projects for customers by the agreed time schedule. And, following expectation of clients, our projects will be appreciated by the clients. 

Testing of various software versions is done only when the quality of the software is exceptionally high. This posting focuses on testing deployment at every stage of the development lifecycle which is possible because of DevOps. There are various types of testing that we will discern and go in depth about the important factors that influence them such as risk-based testing and automation. We will also highlight the numerous benefits DevOps testing brings to developers, testers, and customers.

**Types of Testing =**

1- Unit Testing :
Unit test is the process where each code i.e. modules or components
are tested in isolation, so that there is no dependency on other code.

2- Integration Testing:
The term integration testing refers to a testing process, which provides 
feedback about various components or modules of a system, and allows researchers
to find out whether they operate together in compliance with intended rules.


**Different Aspects of testing =**

1- Metrics and Reporting:
It may involve the balance sheet be financial indicators like the number of test 
cases that are passed vs. failed, bugs detected, regular regeneration and re-test 
affected by DevOps testing, which shed light into which parts of the system most 
likely to fail.

2- Risk-Based Testing :
Testing in DevOps is very risk based to find out and remove the present problems 
from the portal where they can be managed in the early stage, allowing customers and 
owners to be in a constant state of the testing world.

3- Automation:
DevOps is making testing automation a vital part of software development. 
This helps developers to release the software in a faster and more consistent
manner without much quality or reliability issues using consistent testing frameworks.


**Benefits of testing with DevOps :**

1- Improved Efficiency and Speed-
Automation testing in DevOps makes routine processes of testing more economical 
and accelerated thus decreasing delivery cycle time and giving faster feedback 
to developers on developer's side as well as related bugs are identified earlier.

2- Wider Coverage and Consistency-
To start with, automated testing offers the advantage of adjustable coverage, 
it is more consistent, and finally the results are reliable. Ultimately, this 
results in better quality software releases.

3- Lower Testing Costs-
However, the initial investment for automated testing is reduced with very few
manual testing tasks as it speed up software delivery as compared to the traditional
testing method and can run for re-checking numerous number of times without adding 
the cost, hence, enhances the cost effectivity in the long run.

4- Improved Collaboration-
Test automation brings the developers, testers, and stakeholders together prompting 
them to address tasks, and facilitate quick feedback through early bug detection, and 
issue resolution. As a result teamwork is strengthened.

5- Higher Customer Satisfaction-
Autonomy testing which leads to reliable products, quick release of high-quality 
software products, and fewer customer complaints, the overall customer satisfaction 
and product quality are improved.

**Introduction to DevOps:**

Welcome to the "DevOps Handbook," a guide crafted to assist professionals in modern software development.
In today's fast-paced tech world, merging development and operations is vital for organizations 
aiming to deliver top-notch software swiftly.

**Principles of DevOps:**

Collaboration: Foster collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders
 involved in the software development lifecycle.

Automation: Automate repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce errors.
Continuous Integration and Deployment: Continuously integrate code changes into a shared repository 
and deploy them automatically to production environments.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Manage infrastructure through code to enable repeatability, scalability, and consistency.

Monitoring and Feedback: Monitor applications and infrastructure in real-time to gather feedback and improve performance.

Culture of Learning: Encourage a culture of learning, experimentation, and continuous improvement.

**Key Concepts in DevOps:**

Version Control: Utilize version control systems like Git to manage and track changes to code and configurations.

Microservices Architecture: Design applications as a collection of loosely coupled services that can be developed,
deployed, and scaled independently.

Containers: Use containerization technology like Docker to package and deploy applications 
and dependencies consistently across different environments.

Orchestration: Employ orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to automate the deployment, scaling, 
and management of containerized applications.

Infrastructure Automation: Automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration, 
and management using tools like Terraform or Ansible.

**DevOps Tools and Technologies:**

CI/CD Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI

Configuration Management: Ansible, Chef, Puppet

Containerization Platforms: Docker, Kubernetes

Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation

Monitoring and Logging: Prometheus, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

**Building a DevOps culture:**

Encourage collaboration and communication between teams.

Foster a blame-free culture that encourages learning from failures.

Implement cross-functional teams to break down silos.

Provide training and resources to support continuous learning and skill development.

Recognize and reward contributions to the DevOps culture.

**How to maintain security in DevOps:**

Embed security practices into the development process.

Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

**Real-Life Challenges in DevOps:**

Despite the numerous benefits of DevOps, organizations may encounter various challenges during its implementation.
Some common real-life challenges include:

Time wasting: 
During DevOps the ownership of the codebase changes from one team to another; from development to testing,
to deployment and production. During such transitions there is a general waste of time and effort as the environments used
by these teams are separately configured and the codebase must be modified to work smoothly on all these environments.

Challenges with Monitoring the DevOps process: 
One of the most common problems with DevOps is the challenge in holistically monitoring the entire process. DevOps consists
of several moving parts and each of these have different metrics to judge their effectiveness. 
For example a metric like number of code branches or deployment frequency might deal with the 
CI/CD process; whereas something like Defect Escape Rate is a part of the Continuous Testing pipeline. 

In conclusion to our guide to Modern Software Development, DevOps is a powerful approach that enables
organizations to deliver high-quality software faster and more reliably. By embracing DevOps principles,
adopting relevant tools and technologies, and fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement,
teams can overcome traditional barriers between development and operations and achieve greater efficiency, agility,
and innovation in their software delivery process.
